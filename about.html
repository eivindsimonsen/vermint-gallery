      <section class="about-paragraph">
        <p>Vermint is an online art gallery that sells original acrylic paintings on canvas. All paintings are made and signed by norwegian artist Anders Simonsen.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Anders started painting two years ago after he saw a video on instagram that showed a fascinating abstract art method that he wanted to try out for himself. After some, you might say, failed attempts he was eventually satisfied with a painting that he calls "il primo" which is the very first painting that he managed to sell.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>After that, things have gone very well for the young artist. He continued to paint more and more and sold most of his early work locally to family, friends and acquaintances. Eventually he felt it was time for his very first exhibition/gallery. He had an exhibition in January 2021 in collaboration with Ikon concept in Jessheim, Norway. The exhibition was a great success, especially during the coronavirus where government guidelines and measures were strictly followed</p>
        <hr />
        <p>5 original paintings and 2 gicle√© prints were eventually sold. A huge surprise for Anders. He now felt it was time to try and go bigger than just locally. So in collaboration with two frontend developers he now has a wonderful website for Vermint.</p>
